5. DATABASE STRUCTURE AND IMPORTANCE
----------------------------------

The application uses MySQL database with four interconnected tables designed to manage users, books, orders, and order items efficiently:

1. USERS Table
--------------
Columns:
- user_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- username (VARCHAR(50), Unique)
- password (VARCHAR(255))
- email (VARCHAR(100), Unique)
- full_name (VARCHAR(100))
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Importance:
- Stores essential user information for authentication and personalization
- Ensures unique usernames and emails to prevent duplicate accounts
- Password field stores encrypted passwords for security
- Timestamps help track user registration patterns
- Forms the basis for user-specific features like order history
- Primary key user_id links to orders table for relationship mapping

2. BOOKS Table
--------------
Columns:
- book_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- title (VARCHAR(200))
- author (VARCHAR(100))
- price (DECIMAL(10,2))
- stock (INT)
- description (TEXT)
- image_url (VARCHAR(255))
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Importance:
- Central repository for all book information
- Stock field enables inventory management
- Price field with DECIMAL ensures accurate financial calculations
- Description field allows detailed book information
- Image URL enables visual representation of books
- Timestamps help track when books were added to inventory
- Forms the basis for the store's product catalog

3. ORDERS Table
--------------
Columns:
- order_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- user_id (INT, Foreign Key)
- total_amount (DECIMAL(10,2))
- status (VARCHAR(20))
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

Importance:
- Tracks all customer orders
- Links to users table through user_id for order ownership
- Status field enables order tracking (pending, completed, etc.)
- Total amount field maintains order value
- Timestamps help track order patterns
- Enables order history functionality
- Foreign key ensures data integrity with user records

4. ORDER_ITEMS Table
-------------------
Columns:
- order_item_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- order_id (INT, Foreign Key)
- book_id (INT, Foreign Key)
- quantity (INT)
- price (DECIMAL(10,2))

Importance:
- Implements many-to-many relationship between orders and books
- Stores individual items within each order
- Quantity field enables multiple copies of same book in order
- Price field stores the price at time of purchase
- Foreign keys maintain referential integrity
- Enables detailed order information and history
- Facilitates inventory management

Table Relationships:
-------------------
1. Users to Orders (One-to-Many):
   - One user can have multiple orders
   - Each order belongs to exactly one user

2. Orders to Order_Items (One-to-Many):
   - One order can contain multiple items
   - Each order item belongs to exactly one order

3. Books to Order_Items (One-to-Many):
   - One book can appear in multiple order items
   - Each order item references exactly one book

Design Considerations:
---------------------
1. Scalability:
   - Auto-incrementing primary keys allow for unlimited growth
   - Appropriate field sizes accommodate various data requirements

2. Data Integrity:
   - Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
   - UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicate user accounts
   - NOT NULL constraints ensure essential data is provided

3. Performance:
   - Indexed primary and foreign keys for faster queries
   - Appropriate data types for efficient storage
   - Timestamp fields for tracking and auditing

4. Security:
   - Password field sized for secure hash storage
   - Email validation through unique constraint
   - Separate order_items table prevents order tampering

This database design provides a robust foundation for the online bookstore, enabling all core functionalities while maintaining data integrity and performance.
